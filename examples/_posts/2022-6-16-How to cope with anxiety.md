# How to cope with anxiety - **Olivia Remes**

Imagine that you're getting ready to go to a party. You feel excited, but also nervous, and you've got this feeling in your stomach almost like another heartbeat. There's something holding you back, holding you back from getting too happy. "No, you mustn't get too happy. Better to be cautious, otherwise, something bad might happen." You start wondering, "Who should I talk to when I get there? What if no one wants to talk to me? What if they'll think I'm weird?"

想象一下，你正准备去参加一个聚会。你感到兴奋，但也感到紧张，你的胃里有这种感觉，几乎就像另一次心跳一样。有一些东西阻碍了你，阻碍你变得太快乐。“不，你不能太高兴，还是小心点，否则，可能会发生不好的事情。”你开始想，“我到了那里应该和谁说话？如果没有人想和我说话怎么办？如果他们认为我很奇怪怎么办？”

When you arrive at the party, someone comes up to you and starts talking with you, and as this is happening, your mind starts racing, your heart begins pounding, you start sweating, and it feels almost like you're dissociating from yourself, like it's an out-of-body experience, and you're just watching yourself talk. "Keep it together," you say to yourself, but you can't.

当你到达派对时，有人走过来和你交谈，当这发生时，你的大脑开始狂跳，你的心脏开始跳动，你开始出汗，感觉就像你在与自己分离，就像这是一种灵魂出窍的体验，而你只是在看着自己说话。“保持在一起，”你对自己说，但你做不到。

And it's just getting worse: after a few minutes of conversation, the person you've been speaking to leaves, and you feel utterly defeated. This has been happening to you in social situations for a long time. Or imagine every time you go out, and you're in crowded places, you feel this panic starting to arise.

而且情况变得更糟：几分钟的谈话后，你一直在与之交谈的人离开了，你感到彻底失败了。这种情况在社交场合中已经发生了很长时间。或者想象一下，每次你出去，在拥挤的地方，你都会感到这种恐慌开始出现。

When you're surrounded by lots of people, like on a bus, you start to feel hot, nauseous, uneasy, and to prevent this from happening, you start avoiding a lot of places which makes you feel lonely and isolated.

当你被很多人包围时，比如在公共汽车上，你开始感到热、恶心、不安，为了防止这种情况发生，你开始避开很多让你感到孤独和孤立的地方。

You or the person in both of these scenarios have anxiety disorders, and what I can tell you is that anxiety is very common, much more than people think. Right now, one in 14 people around the world have an anxiety disorder, and each year, it costs over 42 billion dollars to treat this mental health problem.

你或这两种情况下的人都有焦虑症，我可以告诉你的是，焦虑很普遍，比人们想象的要多得多。目前，全世界有四分之一的人患有焦虑症，每年治疗这种心理健康问题的费用超过420亿美元。

To show you the impact that anxiety has on someone's life, I will just mention that anxiety can lead to depression, school dropout, suicide. It makes it harder to focus, and to hold down a job, and it can lead to relationship breakdown. But a lot of people don't know this, that's why, a lot of times, people sweep anxiety under the rug as just nerves that you need to get over, as a weakness, but anxiety is so much more than that.

为了向您展示焦虑对某人生活的影响，我只想提到焦虑会导致抑郁、辍学、自杀。它使人更难集中注意力和保住工作，并可能导致关系破裂。但很多人不知道这一点，这就是为什么很多时候，人们把焦虑当作你需要克服的神经，当作弱点，但焦虑远不止于此。

A reason why so many people don't think it's important is that they don't know what it is. Is it your personality? Is it an illness? Is it a normal sensation? What is? That's why it's important to differentiate what is normal anxiety from what is an anxiety disorder.

这么多人认为它不重要的一个原因是他们不知道它是什么。是你的个性吗？是病吗？是正常的感觉吗？什么是？这就是为什么区分什么是正常焦虑和什么是焦虑症很重要。

Normal anxiety is an emotion that we all get when we're in stressful situations. For example, let's say, you're out in the woods, and you come face-to-face with a bear. This will probably make you feel a little bit anxious, and you'll probably want to start running like crazy. This anxious feeling that you get is good because it protects you, it saves you, and it makes you on a hightail it out of there, although maybe it's not such a good idea to start running when you see a bear. I really don't think you can outrun a bear. Anxiety helps us meet our deadlines at work and deal with emergencies in life, but when this anxiety emotion is taken to the extreme and arises in situations which don't pose a real threat, then that's when you might have an anxiety disorder.

正常的焦虑是我们在压力情况下都会产生的一种情绪。例如，假设您在树林里，与一只熊面对面。这可能会让你感到有点焦虑，你可能会想开始疯狂地奔跑。你得到的这种焦虑感是好的，因为它保护了你，拯救了你，它让你高高在上，尽管当你看到一头熊时开始跑步可能不是一个好主意。我真的不认为你能跑得比熊。焦虑有助于我们在工作中完成最后期限并处理生活中的紧急情况，但是当这种焦虑情绪被带到极端时并且出现在不构成真正威胁的情况下，那么那时您可能患有焦虑症。

For example, people with generalized anxiety disorder worry excessively and constantly about everything going on in their lives, and they find it very difficult to control this worry. They also have symptoms like restlessness, fear, they find it hard to fall asleep at night, and they can't concentrate on tasks. In spite of whatever kind of anxiety you might be suffering from, there is something that you can do to lower it.

例如，患有广泛性焦虑症的人会过度担心生活中发生的一切，他们发现很难控制这种担心。他们还有烦躁、恐惧等症状，晚上难以入睡，无法专心工作。尽管您可能会遭受任何类型的焦虑，但您可以采取一些措施来降低它。

It works, and it's simpler than you may think. All too often, we're given medication for mental disorders, but it doesn't always work in the long run. Symptoms often come back, and you're back to where you started. So here's something else to consider: the way you cope or handle things has a direct impact on how much anxiety you're experiencing, and if you tweak the way you're coping, then you can lower your anxiety.

它有效，而且比您想象的要简单。我们经常服用治疗精神疾病的药物，但从长远来看并不总是有效。症状经常回来，你又回到了你开始的地方。所以这里还有一点需要考虑：你应对或处理事情的方式会直接影响你所经历的焦虑程度，如果你调整你的应对方式，那么你就可以降低焦虑。

In our study at the University of Cambridge, we showed that women living in poor areas have a higher risk for anxiety than women living in richer areas. These results didn't surprise us, but when we looked closer, we found that women living in poor areas, if they had a particular set of coping resources, they didn't have anxiety, while women living in poor areas without these coping resources had anxiety.

我们在剑桥大学的研究表明，生活在贫困地区的女性比生活在富裕地区的女性患焦虑症的风险更高。这些结果并不让我们吃惊，但当我们仔细观察时，我们发现生活在贫困地区的女性，如果她们有一套特定的应对资源，她们并没有焦虑，而生活在贫困地区的女性则没有这些应对资源有焦虑。

Other studies showed that people who had faced extreme circumstances, who had faced adversity, been through wars and natural disasters, if they had coping resources, they remained healthy and free of mental disorders, while others, facing the same hardships but without coping skills went on a downward spiral and developed mental disorders.

其他研究表明，那些经历过极端环境、逆境、经历过战争和自然灾害的人，如果他们有应对资源，他们仍然保持健康，没有精神障碍，而其他人面临同样的困难，但没有应对技巧呈螺旋式下降并发展为精神障碍。

So what are some of these coping resources, and how can we use them to lower our anxiety? And before I dive into what they are, I'd like to point out - and I think this is so interesting - you can develop these coping resources or coping skills on your own through the things that you do; you can take charge of your anxiety and lower it, which I think is so empowering.

那么这些应对资源有哪些，我们如何利用它们来降低焦虑呢？在我深入探讨它们是什么之前，我想指出——我认为这很有趣——你可以通过你所做的事情自己开发这些应对资源或应对技能；你可以控制自己的焦虑并降低它，我认为这很有力量。

Today I'll be talking about three coping resources, and the first one is feeling like you're in control of your life. People who feel like they're more in control of their life have better mental health. If you feel like you're lacking in control in life, then research shows that you should engage in experiences that give you greater control. I'll show you what I mean: do you sometimes find that you put off starting something because you just don't feel ready enough? Do you find it hard to make decisions like what to wear, what to eat who to date, which job to take up? Do you tend to waste a lot of time deciding what you might do while nothing gets done? A way to overcome indecision and this lack of control in life, is to do it badly.

今天我将谈论三个应对资源，第一个是感觉你可以控制自己的生活。感觉自己更能控制自己的生活的人有更好的心理健康。如果您觉得自己在生活中缺乏控制力，那么研究表明，您应该参与能够让您获得更大控制权的体验。我会告诉你我的意思：你是否有时会因为感觉还没有准备好而推迟开始做某事？你是否觉得很难做出决定，比如穿什么，吃什么，约会谁，从事什么工作？你是否倾向于浪费大量时间来决定你可以做什么而什么都没做？克服优柔寡断和生活中缺乏控制的一种方法就是做得不好。

There's a quote by writer and poet GK Chesterton that says, "Anything worth doing is worth doing badly the first time." The reason why this works so well is that it speeds up your decision-making and catapults you straight into action, otherwise, you can spend hours deciding how you should go about doing something or what you should do. This can be paralyzing and can make you afraid to even begin. All too often, we aim for perfection, but never end up doing anything because the standards that we set for ourselves are too high, they're intimidating, which stresses us out so we delay starting something, or we might even abandon the whole thing altogether. Do it badly frees you up to take action. I mean you know how it is: so often, we want to do something perfectly we can't start until it's the perfect time, until we've got all the skills, but this can be daunting and stressful so why not just jump into it just do it however, without worrying if it's good or bad? This will make it that much easier to start something and as you're doing it badly to finish it, and when you look back, you'll realize, more often than not, that actually it's not that bad.

作家兼诗人 GK Chesterton 有一句名言：“任何值得做的事情都值得第一次做坏事。”之所以如此有效，是因为它可以加快您的决策速度并让您直接采取行动，否则，您可能会花费数小时来决定应该如何做某事或应该做什么。这可能会让人瘫痪，甚至会让你害怕开始。很多时候，我们追求完美，但永远不会做任何事情，因为我们为自己设定的标准太高了，它们令人生畏，这让我们感到压力，所以我们推迟开始做某事，或者我们甚至可能放弃整件事共。做得不好会让你有时间采取行动。我的意思是你知道它是怎么回事：很多时候，我们想要完美地做一些事情，直到时机成熟，我们才能开始，直到我们掌握了所有技能，但这可能会令人生畏和压力，所以为什么不直接跳入它只是这样做，而不用担心它是好还是坏？这将使开始某件事变得容易得多，而当你做得不好以完成它时，当你回头看时，你往往会意识到，实际上它并没有那么糟糕。

A close friend of mine who has anxiety started using this motto, and this is what she said, "When I started using this motto, my life transformed. I found I could complete tasks in much shorter time periods than before. Do it badly gave me wings to take risks, to try something differently, and to have way more fun during the whole process. It took the anxiety out of everything and replaced it with excitement." So do it badly, and you can improve as you go along. I'd like to ask you to think about this: if you start using this motto today, how would your life change?

我的一个有焦虑症的朋友开始使用这句话，她是这样说的，“当我开始使用这句格言时，我的生活发生了变化。我发现我可以在比以前更短的时间内完成任务。做得不好给我愿意冒险，尝试不同的东西，并在整个过程中获得更多乐趣。它消除了一切的焦虑，取而代之的是兴奋。”所以做得不好，你可以随着你的进步而进步。我想请你想一想：如果你今天开始使用这个座右铭，你的生活会如何改变？

The second coping strategy is to forgive yourself, and this is very powerful if you use it. People with anxiety think a lot about what they're doing wrong, their worries, and how bad they're feeling. Imagine if you had a friend who constantly pointed out everything you're doing wrong, and everything that was wrong with your life. You would probably want to get rid of this person right away, wouldn't you? Well, people with anxiety do this to themselves all day long. They're not kind to themselves. So maybe it's time to start being kinder with ourselves, time to start supporting ourselves, and a way to do this is to forgive yourself for any mistakes you think you might have made just a few moments ago to mistakes made in the past.

第二个应对策略是原谅自己，如果你使用它，这是非常强大的。患有焦虑症的人会想很多关于他们做错了什么、他们的担忧以及他们的感觉有多糟糕。想象一下，如果你有一个朋友不断指出你做错的每一件事，以及你生活中的每一件事。您可能想立即摆脱这个人，不是吗？好吧，焦虑的人整天对自己这样做。他们对自己不友善。所以也许是时候开始对自己友善了，是时候开始支持自己了，而做到这一点的方法就是原谅自己认为的任何错误你可能刚刚犯了过去犯过的错误。

If you had a panic attack and are embarrassed about it, forgive yourself; if you wanted to talk to someone, but couldn't muster up the courage to do so, don't worry about it, let it go; forgive yourself for anything and everything and this will give you greater compassion towards yourself. You can't begin to heal until you do this.

如果您惊恐发作并为此感到尴尬，请原谅自己；如果你想和某人说话，但又没有勇气这样做，别担心，放手；原谅自己的一切，这会让你对自己有更大的同情心。在你这样做之前，你无法开始治愈。

And last but not least, having a purpose and meaning in life is a very important coping mechanism. Whatever we do in life, whatever work we produce, however much money we make, we cannot be fully happy until we know that someone else needs us, that someone else depends on our accomplishments, or on the love that we have to share. It's not that we need other people's good words to keep going in life, but if we don't do something with someone else in mind, then we're at much higher risk for poor mental health.

最后但并非最不重要的一点是，在生活中拥有目标和意义是一种非常重要的应对机制。无论我们在生活中做什么，无论我们做什么工作，无论我们赚多少钱，在我们知道别人需要我们、别人依赖于我们的成就或我们必须分享的爱之前，我们都无法完全快乐。并不是说我们需要别人的好话才能继续生活，但如果我们不为别人做某事，那么我们患心理健康状况不佳的风险就会高得多。

The famous neurologist Dr. Victor Frankel said, "For people who think there's nothing to live for and nothing more to expect from life, the question is getting these people to realize that life is still expecting something from them."

著名的神经学家维克多·弗兰克尔博士说：“对于那些认为没有什么可以为之而活、对生活没有更多期望的人来说，问题是让这些人意识到生活仍然对他们有所期待。”

Doing something with someone else in mind can carry you through the toughest times. You'll know the why for your existence and will be able to bear almost any how; almost any how. So the question is do you do at least one thing with someone else in mind?

与他人一起做某事可以带您度过最艰难的时期。你会知道你存在的原因，并且几乎可以承受任何方式；几乎任何方式。所以问题是你至少在做一件事时会考虑到别人吗？

This could be volunteering, or it could be sharing this knowledge that you gained today with other people, especially those who need it most, and these are often the people who don't have money for therapy, and they're usually the ones with the highest rates of anxiety disorders. Give it to them, share with others, because it can really improve your mental health.

这可能是志愿服务，也可能是与其他人分享你今天获得的知识，尤其是那些最需要它的人，而这些人通常没有钱进行治疗，而他们通常是那些焦虑症的发病率最高。把它给他们，与他人分享，因为它真的可以改善你的心理健康。

So I would like to conclude with this: another way you can do something with someone else in mind is finishing work that might benefit future generations. Even if these people will never realize what you've done for them, it doesn't matter, because you will know, and this will make you realize the uniqueness and importance of your life.

所以我想以此作为结束：另一种可以与他人一起做某事的方式是完成可能有益于后代的工作。即使这些人永远不会意识到你为他们做了什么，也没关系，因为你会知道，这会让你意识到你生命的独特性和重要性。

Thank you. (Applause)

谢谢你。（掌声）
